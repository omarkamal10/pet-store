# Pet store Api

I implemented most of endpoints in the pet store swagger spec from scratch and added the two main end points my code structure and organization.

## Setup and running the project

1. Clone the code from github or download it
2. Install node dependencies ➡ `npm install`
3. If you have docker Run Docker Compose ➡ `docker-compose up`
4. If no docker available just run ➡ `npm run dev`

That's all you need to run the project.

## Testing

Code exists in tests folder in src

1. Install node dependencies if you haven't already ➡ `npm install`
2. Run instance of server ➡ `npm run dev`
3. Run command ➡ `npm test`

## Documentation

Postman collection in Documentation folder
Base URL ➡ http://localhost:9000/api

### When the project first starts there will be some seeded data:

1. 3 users with these credentials:
   - username: user1, password: 1234
   - username: user2, password: 1234
   - username: user3, password: 1234
2. A pet with category of Dog with id: 1
3. An auction created by user1 for other users to bid on the pet above. Note that the user that created the auction cannot bid in his own pet sale.
   - auctionId: 1
   - petId: 1

### I added three main endpoint for the challenge as per my understanding.

All of these endpoint require authentication so the user must login

1. User to bid on specific pet - POST ➡ http://localhost:9000/api/auction/:auctionId/bid
2. Pet owner to list all bids in general - GET ➡ http://localhost:9000/api/auction/bid/all ➡ Return all bids for all pets for that particular user
3. Pet owner to list all bids for specific pet - GET ➡ http://localhost:9000/api/auction/bid/pet/:petId ➡ Return all bids for that particular petId for that particular user

### Example scenario to test the challenge endpoints.

Note: When logging in make sure to put token in Authorization Bearer Token

1. As user1 is the owner of the auction and the seller/owner of that pet so only he can see all the bids made on that pet or in his other pets as well.
2. Login with user2 and place token in Authorization Bearer token
3. place a bid - POST ➡ http://localhost:9000/api/auction/1/bid with json body {"amount":50}
4. user2 cannot place another bid until another user places a bid.
5. Login with user3 and place token in Authorization Bearer token
6. place a bid - POST ➡ http://localhost:9000/api/auction/1/bid with json body {"amount":60}. Note that if the amount is less than the highest bid, it will result in an error stating to place a higher bid.

7. Login with user1 and place token in Authorization Bearer token
8. Check the bids on that particular pet - GET ➡ http://localhost:9000/api/auction/bid/pet/1 ➡ will return array of bids made with each bidder value as the userId
   [
   {
   "amount": 50,
   "bidder": 2
   },
   {
   "amount": 60,
   "bidder": 3
   ]
9. You can test the other endpoint as per the postman collection with their input data.
